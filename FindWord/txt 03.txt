
Did you already watch some hacker film? If yes, I bet you became a
victim of those hacker scenes. The scene where the hacker type fast in front of
computer and a black terminal and green font texts will appear. Then after that
fast typing in the keyboard, the lights in the city will be turned off just like that.
Well, thatâ€™s partially not true because in order to execute that kind of big hack,
you need a lot of preparation and strategy, not like that in those movie scenes
that they did it just within few minutes.
If you are an ethical hacker (good hacker), you must know that there is a
process that we have to do in order to make the hack successful. Most of the
time, because most of the system now are being secured, the chance of hacking
a certain system is decreasing that means you need to put a lot of effort and
time just to make it. The process that I am talking about will be tackled later on
within this book, step-by-step.
