
Imagine if I gave a child a stethoscope. That child learn how to use it and
became an expert in using that kind of tool. However, can we consider him a
doctor? The answer is no. This is the same in the ethical hacking world. Not
just because you know how to use hacking tools you can now proclaim
yourself already a hacker.
Hacking is all about strategy. It is the creation of strategy of how you
will use certain resources to your advantage and how you can learn more about
the target. Tools are just subordinate that can make your life easier but all in all
you need to think like a hacker in order to be one.
